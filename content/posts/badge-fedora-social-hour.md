*This article is originally inspired by Justin W. Flory's Gotta Badge `em All series about [how to earn specific Fedora badges](https://blog.jwf.io/2015/11/gotta-badge-em-introduction-fedora-badges/).*

## Fedora Social Panda: What's it about?
**How It all Started is,** As COVID-19 is getting pretty real and resulting in people
performing social distancing, shelter-in-place & Lockdowns resulting in most of us feeling pretty isolated
so out Fedora Project Leader **Matthew Miller** & Fedora Project Contributor **Neal Gompa** had the idea to have a Fedora Social Hour
where folks could Chat & get a little e-human contact and conversation.

Now, let's focus on the badge now, As we have activities in Fedora, We have Badges, the [Fedora Social Panda](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/social-panda)
badge is categorized as "Event Badge" and it's crieteria is defined in this [Pagure ticket](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/issue/731)

In short, The *Fedora Social Panda* Badge is awarded to folks we participate in a [Fedora Social Hour](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/come-socialize-at-the-fedora-social-hour-2/) with the Community.

## How do I earn "Fedora Social Panda"
In order to earn this badge, you would have to join a weekly fedora social hour.

### How do I know when it's happening?
To know when a Fedora Social Hour will be organized, Keep an eye on the [Fedora Community Blog](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/), As that's where most of the announcements are made for the Community.

Another preffered way is to keep an eye is by joining the [Fedora Social Hour](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#fedora-social-hour:matrix.org) on Riot.im, As this is where we have our Social Hours nowadays, as it has Jitsi & Etherpad widgets that we've implemented.

If you would like to stick with the Freenode IRC Channel, it's `#fedora-social-hour` on Freenode IRC that is bridged with the Matrix Room.

Once, You attend a Fedora Social Hour, you can share your `FAS ID` for the organizers to award that badge to you.
