## I Voted Fedora 33: What it's about?
The [I Voted Fedora 33 Badge](https://badges.fedoraproject.org/badge/i-voted%3A-fedora-33) is categorized as **Community Badge** and it's defined in this [Pagure Ticket](https://pagure.io/fedora-badges/issue/725)

### But What it's all About ?

In short, it's what it says in the Description : *"You participated in Fedora 33 Elections"*. It is awarded to people who vote in the [Fedora Elections](https://elections.fedoraproject.org/).

#### What are Fedora Elections ?

Fedora has several elected bodies that regularly conduct elections every release cycle. In addition, Fedora teams can request one-off elections from the Fedora Program Manager when trying to select new leadership or otherwise reach a decision through a formal voting process.

We currently have 3 Open Elections, that takes place every release whenever we have a free seat including:
- FESCo (Engineering) [Fedora Engineering & Steering Committee]
- Mindshare Committee. (Community) [I'm running for the Mindshare seat this year too]
- Fedora Council.

#### How the Election Process works ?

Fedora Implements a **Range voting system**, which works on the principle of allowing voters to rate as many candidates as they want on scale from `1` to `4`.

This method is designed to give voters the option of splitting their vote and showing their level of preference of a subset of candidates over another.

Once voting ends, votes are tallied using the summing method (addition of all votes) to generate a final score for a candidate.
